#Findr

## the game plan 
Findr is going to be a tinder-like project I want to have the swiping function like tinder instead of finding partners you’re finding movies

I want it to be a couple centred app but with the option of singles 

When we have a couple of users I want them to be able to connect to each other so then they have a shared watch list where if both users swipe yes on a movie it goes into their shared watch list 

I want either person to be able to set a movie to watched in their watch list 

If users are looking for a specific genre or time range I want to have fields for both of those things 


I want a watch button that takes you to a movie website to watch the movie

## the steps 

1. Which at the time of writing this I’ve completed is setting up the database tables for everything in the app including mock data in seeds file 
2. Create models 
3. Set up api integration tmdb 
4. Auth and user set up 
5. Build partner connection 
6. Build swipe mechanic similar to group project 
7. Shared watch list 
8. Personal watch list 
9. Movie details and watch 
10. CSS 


will add more when i come across things ive missed 
will also flesh out the steps more when doing them 

```
git clone [your-project-ssh-address]
cd [your-project-name]
npm install # to install dependencies
npm run dev # to start the dev server
```

You can find the server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the client running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
